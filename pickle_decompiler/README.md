Decompiles Python pickles into Dart objects.

## Getting started

Install this library with:
``
dart pub add pickle_decompiler
``

Use the package.

## Additional information

This package is REALLY not production ready, it's just a proof of concept, 
which doesn't support the full spec of Pickle protocol 5.
There is also pretty much no documentation available for the time being.
There's also no tests or examples currently available.

So, **do not use it in production**.
